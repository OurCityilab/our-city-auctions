## Bidding Tactics

### The Psychology of Auctions

#### Early Properties
- Often go cheaper (people save cash)
- Good for value hunters
- Less competition
- Set the market tone

#### Middle Properties
- Most competitive
- True market values
- Highest quality usually here
- Budget carefully

#### Late Properties
- Desperation deals
- Cash-strapped competition
- Hidden gems possible
- All-in opportunities

### Bidding Strategies

#### 1. The Early Bird
- Bid aggressively on first properties
- Secure wins while others hesitate
- Risk: Overpay without market sense

#### 2. The Patient Wolf
- Watch and learn
- Let others exhaust funds
- Strike on later properties
- Risk: Miss best properties

#### 3. The Precision Striker
- Target 2-3 specific properties
- Bid maximum on these only
- Ignore everything else
- Risk: Win nothing if outbid

#### 4. The Opportunist
- No fixed targets
- Bid on any value
- Flexible strategy
- Risk: Unfocused portfolio

### Bidding Mathematics

#### Quick ROI Calculation
```
Estimated After-Repair Value (ARV): $150,000
Minus Renovation Costs: -$30,000
Minus Purchase Price: -$45,000
Equals Potential Profit: $75,000

ROI = (Profit / Investment) √ó 100
ROI = ($75,000 / $75,000) √ó 100 = 100%
```

#### The 70% Rule
Professional investors often use:
- Maximum Bid = (ARV √ó 0.70) - Renovation Costs
- Example: ($150,000 √ó 0.70) - $30,000 = $75,000 max bid

## Negotiation Guide

### Understanding Occupants

#### Occupant Types
1. **Recent Widow/Widower**
   - High emotional attachment
   - Needs empathy and time
   - Offer: Extended move-out, rent-back

2. **Struggling Family**
   - Financial desperation
   - Needs stability
   - Offer: Rent-to-own, payment assistance

3. **Defiant Owner**
   - Legal knowledge
   - Won't leave easily
   - Offer: Cash for keys, legal compliance

4. **Elderly Resident**
   - Limited alternatives
   - Health concerns
   - Offer: Relocation assistance, family connection

### Negotiation Approaches

#### Trust Building Phrases
‚úÖ "I understand this is difficult"
‚úÖ "Let's work together"
‚úÖ "What would help you most?"
‚úÖ "I want to find a fair solution"

#### Trust Destroying Phrases
‚ùå "You have to leave now"
‚ùå "It's just business"
‚ùå "I don't care about your situation"
‚ùå "The law is on my side"

### Negotiation Outcomes

|---------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Stay as Owner | Keep home | Finder's fee | Very Rare |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Researching Everything Equally**
   - Waste credits on properties you'll never win
   - Solution: Quick peek first, then focus

2. **Emotional Bidding**
   - Getting caught in bidding wars
   - Solution: Set maximum and stick to it

3. **Ignoring Occupants**
   - Assuming vacant is always better
   - Solution: Occupied can mean steady rental income

4. **Cash Hoarding**

   - Solution: 70-80% withdrawal is usually optimal

5. **Analysis Paralysis**
   - Overthinking during preview
   - Solution: Trust your instincts after research
